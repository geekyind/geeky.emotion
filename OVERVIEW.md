## 🛡️ How We Keep You Safe

**Anonymization Pipeline**
- Every post gets a cryptographic anonymous ID
- Personal details are automatically removed
- Your identity lives in a separate, encrypted vault

**Smart Moderation**
- AI screens for harmful content in real-time (<100ms)
- Crisis detection triggers immediate intervention
- Human professionals review flagged content within 1 hour

**Privacy by Design**
- Two separate databases: one for your identity, one for content
- Zero-knowledge architecture—we can't connect posts to real identities
- Complete data encryption at rest and in transit

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Inspired by **Lore.co**, we believe emotional support should feel:

- **Warm** → Soft blues and sage greens that calm
- **Safe** → Clear privacy indicators everywhere
- **Empowering** → You control your data and experience
- **Human** → Conversational, never clinical
